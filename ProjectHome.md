All the framework I've looked at so far are very complicated, mix PHP and HTML, and are based on stupid ORMs. I completely agree with Rasmus Lerdorf (the father of PHP) when he writes about frameworks :

So I created a light framework glueing simple ABOdb and Smarty. Not that happy with ADOdb, I wrote my own database access class. Then again, it's very simple, but I added some features so it would make development easier.

fastFramework is very light, so you won't take days to learn to use it.

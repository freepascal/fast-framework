-2- svn co http://svn.metacites.net/FFW FFW
-3- after that, you need some librairies :
	PHP librairies needed :
		- Spyc
		- Smarty
		- adodb
		- phpMailer ???
	JavaScript librairies needed :
		- Jquery
		- FCKeditor
	
	Download them and link them all
-4- cd to your www directory
-5- mv FFW/www_index.php to WWW/index.php
-6- mkdir the directory where you will put your modules (preferably out of WWW)
-7- mv FFW/www_config.yml to somewhere config.yml and write into it
-8- write a WWW/.htaccess so that using mod_rewrite all that goes to WWW is rewriten to WWW/index.php
	(look into FFW/www_htaccess if you want to)

should be all
